The PaintBall project uses the pygame library.
A game window opens and you move the ball with the joystick.
At the moment the game only supports Xbox and PlayStation controllers; in the project there is a Unitest folder where I can test the controllers.
When I start the tests and if the controller test is successful, an xml file is created containing all the characteristics of the controller
